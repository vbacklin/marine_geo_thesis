# Digital Appendix
Digital supplement to the B.Sc. thesis in Marine Geology ''Identification of Gas Seeps Associated with Fracture Zones in the Southwestern Baltic Sea Using Open-Source Software"
The repository is a hub for the .gif animations mentioned in the thesis, as well as a python scrip used for water current calculations. 

The animations belong to two main categories; along-track bottom sidelobes and seep-like targets.
Every animated artifact has its own folder, containing GIF animations and some of the pings used for their creation as reference if you want to have a closer look at anything specific.

In the folder for along-track bottom sidelobes artifacts are present; one from Area 1 and one from Area 3 (Artifact E, mentioned in the thesis).
The folder for seep-like targets has subfolders for the areas where seep-like targets were found; Area 1 and Area 2. 

The most interesting anamolies, and the focus of Section 7.1 "Interpretation of Acoustic Anomalies" in the thesis, can be found in the Area 2 subfolder.

The animations for the seep-like targets are available in two versions, normal and reversed (with the file suffix "_rev"). If we choose to interpret these as seeps, most of the targets are encountered by the MBES at their termimal point first, due to how they are angled compared to the travel direction of the vessel. Because of this, temporally reversing the ping order creates an animation that starts at the seep origin and the vertical structure can be followed throughout the water column. This does lead to an interpretative bias, which is why an animation created with the normal ordering of pings is provided for comparison. Viewing the normal animationsm while disregarding the seep-interpretations, the animation shows targets that dive down towards the bottom as they are encountered by the MBES. This is discussed in the thesis as possible vessel avoidant Herring behavior. The interpretation of these anomalies remains uncertain.
